This package provides a single library `Math.Scythe` which provides the function `scythe` and the data types `Hasse` and `HasseDiagram`. `scythe` is a functional programming implementation, in Haskell, of the algorithm of the same name described by Justin Curry, [Robert Ghrist and Vridit Nanda in the paper *Discrete Morse theory for computing cellular sheaf cohomology*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6454).

This, however, is just a preliminary version where we do not take into acount a sheaf ont the poset, therefore we merely reduce the poset to it's critical morse data. Such extensions are planned to be implemented in the (hopefully near) future.
